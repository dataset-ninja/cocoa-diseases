According to Fedecacao sources, the total production of Theobroma cacao L cocoa in Colombia for 2018 exceeded 56 thousand tons, making it the second-highest in history despite a 6% reduction compared to 2017. The decrease in production was attributed to factors such as flowering flows, increased incidence of the Monilia disease, and floods caused by heavy rainfall early in the year. In response to the need for reliable inspection procedures to assess crop infections, the authors of the dataset developed a mobile application prototype that utilizes artificial intelligence techniques and image analysis to identify diseased cocoa pods.

The research collected data to create a dataset containing data on the most concerning diseases affecting cocoa crops, such as *Phytophthora* and *Monilia*. The authors employed YOLOv4, a machine learning algorithm, to train a model with a 60% accuracy in detecting cocoa pods. The results show promise for the application's potential usefulness as a mobile tool for farmers and agricultural researchers. The tool can aid in decision-making processes, providing an accurate evaluation of cocoa pod infections without the need for an expert trained in cocoa crop phytosanitary management.

To consolidate and standardize the database for calibration, training, and development activities, the authors conducted a data collection survey that involved capturing step images of the cocoa pods. They collaborated with SENA (National Service of Learning) and visited the agricultural sector's attention center in Play√≥n, Santander. The images were captured following standardized procedures, including setting specific camera characteristics such as focal point, exposure time, ISO speed, lens compensation exposure, focal length, maximum aperture, metering mode, and flash mode. The images were then labeled and coded using the LabelImg tool to distinguish between diseased and healthy cocoa pods. The set of images containing diseased and healthy cocoa pods was consolidated for later use in training the machine learning model.
